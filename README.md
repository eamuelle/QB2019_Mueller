Quantitative Biodiveristy course, Spring 2019, Indiana University
Emmi Mueller, emamuell@iu.edu

I am a second year graduate student in Jay Lennon's lab. I am interested in the effects of physically complex environments on microbial communities in multiple systems including the mammalian gut. I am a former dancer and danced from age 4 to age 14.

Course Expectations:
1. Feel more comfortable with git, github and R.
2. Learn how to use biodiversity metrics to think about patterns like those from the Vellend 2010 paper.
3. Feel comfortable with the theory behind ordination and multivariate statistical methods.
4. Have a good set of resources for the rest of my life that I can refer to as needed.
